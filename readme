General description of project

1. pip install -r requirements.txt:
This file contains all the necessary dependencies to run the model. Use the above
command to install all the dependencies. This step cannot be skipped.

2. python setup.py:
This file reads from the datasets folder which contains the datasets for the
ML model's training and testing. If the datasets folder is altered, make sure
to change setup.py accordingly so that the training and testing datasets are
accurately changed.

3. python train.py:
This file reads the datasets from setup.py and then build and trains a model.
The file saves a .h5 file of the model which can be used later. Once this file
is generated, you need not run it again unless you would like to retrain the
model on different data.

4. python run.py:
This file finally uses the saved model from train.py to classify the test
dataset. If you would like to alter just the test data, you can do so in set up
and then simply run this file again to view the model performance

5. driver file
